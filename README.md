## Project Structure

The project is divided into two main parts:

1. **SQL Queries**: Contains various SQL queries used for data analysis. These queries help compute KPIs, analyze sales trends, and determine top/bottom pizzas by revenue, quantity, and orders.
2. **Tableau Dashboard**: The visual output of the data analysis is displayed through an interactive Tableau dashboard. This dashboard is designed to provide meaningful insights into the pizza sales data.
